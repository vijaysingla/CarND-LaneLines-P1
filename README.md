Overview
---

In this project I detected lanes in images and videos using Python and OpenCV.

My git repo consists of following folders
1. test_images- it consists of images that I tested my algorithm on 
2. test_images_output -it consists of resultant images that are the ouptut of my lane detection algorithm 
3. test_videos -it consists of test videos I used to test my algorithm
4. test_videos_output-it consists of video outputs yielded by lane detection algorithm
5. P1.ipynb-this is my lane detection algorithm in Python
6. write_template- Brief decriptiion explaining the algorithm.
